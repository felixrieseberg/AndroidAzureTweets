# Azure Tweets (for Android)
A sample Twitter-Style app using [Azure Mobile Apps](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/mobile/) (formerly known as Azure Mobile Services) for Android. It's reasonable simple and showcases how to make a connected app (with data syncing cross devices) in a few minutes. As of April 2015, it's using all the new stuff - Material Design, Futures, and the Mobile Services SDK 2.
