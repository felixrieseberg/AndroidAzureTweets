# Azure Tweets (for Android)
A sample Twitter-Style app using Azure Mobile Services for Android. It's reasonable simple and showcases how to make a connected app (with data syncing cross devices) in a few minutes. As of April 2015, it's using all the new stuff - Material Design, Futures, and the Mobile Services SDK 2.

This is still a work in progress.
